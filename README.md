# Unity - Weighted Random utility

This is a small repo that exists purely to house a utility for generating weighted pseudo-random numbers for use with Unity.

For what it's worth it would be trivial to alter this for use with regular .NET C#, it just uses the native Unity implementation of `Random` and `Mathf` under the hood, which could be replaced with `System.Random` and `System.Math`.

## Including in your project

The class itself is found at `Assets/Scripts/Util/RandomUtil.cs` and is all you need, just dump it into your Assets folder somewhere and reference it from your code.

## Using

The `RandomUtil` class is static and simply exposes a few functions that you can call from anywhere in your code.

### Functions

 - `Polynomial(float min, float max)`
    - Get a random number between `min` (inclusive) and `max` (exclusive) weighted by a 2nd-order polynomial (i.e. `x^2`). This is to say that the most likely values generated will be close to `min` and `max` and the least likely values generated will be the midpoint between `min` and `max` (i.e. `(max + min) / 2`). See [this plot](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+%28x%5E2%29+where+-10+%3C+x+%3C+10) for a visualisation.
 - `Guassian(float min, float max)`
    - Get a random number between `min` (inclusive) and `max` (exclusive) weighted by a Guassian (aka "Normal") distribution. Technically speaking, the distribution is centered on the midpoint between `min` and `max` (i.e. `(max + min) / 2`) and extends out 3 standard distributions. This is to say that the most likely values generated will be the midpoint between `min` and `max` (i.e. `(max + min) / 2`) and the least likely values generated will be close to `min` and `max` (similar but not identical to the inverse of the `Polynomial` distribution).
